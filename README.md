# Create Arweave Wallet file

A command line program that creates an Arweave wallet JSON file.

### Usage

Generate a wallet using:

        npx @permaweb/wallet wallet.json

or 

        npx @permaweb/wallet

If you provide a filename (`wallet.json` in the example), the generated wallet will be saved with that filename. If no filename is provided, the program will prompt you to enter a filename, and the wallet will be saved accordingly.
